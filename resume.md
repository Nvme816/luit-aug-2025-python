## SUMMARY

Cloud Operations, Security, Site Reliability, Infrastructure, and Platform Engineering professional with experience spanning AWS, Azure, and hybrid cloud environments. My background bridges data center operations, security leadership, and cloud engineering, with a focus on resilience, compliance, and secure-by-design systems.

I’ve helped organizations protect multi-million-dollar operations by sustaining uptime, reduce incidents through automation and observability, strengthen IAM and Zero Trust controls, and enhance reliability across cloud and edge infrastructures.

Currently advancing expertise through a Cloud DevOps Engineering Apprenticeship and a Director-led DevOps mentorship program in leadership, Infrastructure-as-Code, and cloud automation.

## PROJECTS

### Automated S3/Lambda/DynamoDB CI/CD with IAM Least Privileges (Automation/IaC) 
*Use Case: Automate secure deployment pipelines for serverless workloads with least-privilege IAM.*

- Designed a secure, least-privilege CI/CD pipeline integrating S3, Lambda, and DynamoDB to automate static content deployment, improving operational resilience and deployment security:
  - Operations: Automated deployments, improving uptime and reliability
  - Site Reliability: Strengthening reliability objectives and reducing manual intervention
  - Security: Enforcing least privilege and secure automaton
  - Platform: Building reusable CU/CD foundations for multi-service environments

### Image Rekognition Automation CI/CD Pipeline (Observability/Monitoring) 
*Use Case: Enable automated media analysis and monitoring for ML-based workloads.*

- Built an automated Rekognition pipeline with GitHub Actions for S3-to-DynamoDB monitoring, improving observability, scalability, and SRE-aligned metrics collection:  
  - Site Reliability: Strengthening observability through automated logging and metric tracking
  - Operations: Scaling content monitoring pipelines and ensuring data processing reliability
  - Infrastructure: Integrating managed services (S3, DynamoDB, Rekognition) to optimize cost and performance
  - Security: Validating pipeline integrity and secure data handling (images/audio)

### Zero Trust with AWS IAM Portless Auditable Access via Systems Manager 
*Use Case: Replace traditional SSH/RDP access with portless, auditable Zero Trust access for EC2 management.*

- Implemented IAM-based Zero Trust access using AWS Systems Manager to replace SSH/RDP, achieving full auditability, improved reliability, and reduced attack surface:  
  - Security: Core Zero Trust enforcement and credentialless session management
  - IAM: Implemented IAM Session Manager access policies and auditing
  - Site Reliability: Improved reliability and reduced attack surface by removing open ports
  - Infrastructure: Strengthened management of EC2 lifecycle under secure access controls
 
### Apache Deployment (Infra/Platform)
*Use Case: Deploy and harden public web infrastructure with secure access and governance controls.*

- Deployed and secured a public-facing Apache web server on EC2:  
  - Validating connectivity and custom HTML delivery 
  - Hardening access controls to demonstrate: 
    - Infrastructure build
    - Platform reliability
    - Compliance & Governance
